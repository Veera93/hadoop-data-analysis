 (Reuters) - Twitter's ban on cryptocurrency advertising will start on Tuesday, the social media company told Reuters. The prohibition will cover advertising of initial coin offerings (ICOs) - crowdfunding used to raise cash by creating new coins -  as well as token sales, the San-Francisco-based firm said, confirming an earlier Reuters report on Monday.
